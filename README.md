# UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There

## Overview 
#### The purpose of this project is to create a website that houses UFO sighting data that can be filtered on multiple criteria.  By using javascript to create filters, users can filter the data by date, city, state, country and shape.

 

## Results

#### The site we created has many useful components that will help UFO researchers and enthusiants gather data on UFO sightings.  The first component is the article, split between one section on the left with the title and the section on the right with the body of the article.

#### At the bottom of the page is the UFO sighting detail in a nicely arranged table.  The table has column titles and each row is the data for an indivual UFO sighting.  Ther is a lot of information to wade through, so there are five filters on the left side to narrow down your search criteria.

#### There are five different search criteria listed; date, city, state, country, and shape.  You will notice, there are also examples already present in the search boxes, so you know the correct format to use when entering the search criteria in each field. To narrow down your search results, you can enter dat into any or all of the boxes.  The more information you enter, the more specific your results will be.  As you move from one box to the next, you will notice the data in the table changes to fit only the criteria that is listed.

## Summary
#### Though this website is a great tool to research UFO sightings, there is one drawback to it's functionality.  There is a lot of data, and you may not know exactly what you are looking for so it can be difficult to know what information to put in the search criteria.  For example, you may want to search by shape, but not know what potential shapes to look for.  The user would have to spend a lot of time digging through the website to find what shapes are listed before being able to efficiently use the filtering mechanism.

#### One recommendation that I have is to have drop-down lists of possible search criteria.  As mentioned in the previous statement, it would be helpful if in the filter box, the user could have a pre-made list of possible shapes to search for.  This would be helpful for the city, state and country categories as well.

#### My second recommendation is that the date filter is a date range.  It would be useful to be able to search for all sightings within a specified date range, such as a week or month.  This would be helpful to see if there were multiple UFO sightings in a time window within a certain location.
